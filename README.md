This is a c++ project to display a window showing 3 random positive english words at a time from a list of 2007 words.

The list was taken from here https://gist.github.com/mkulakowski2/4289437

It is ensured that there is no repetition of the same words until all 2007 words are displayed in random order.
After which the cycle repeats again as the temporary vector is refilled with all 2007 words.

Aside from this there are 9 images of which 3 are randomly displayed below each word(with repetition);
